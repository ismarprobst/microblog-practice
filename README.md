# microblog-practice
This is an application for a micro-blog, where the author can publish news and the readers can comment it. I've used Java Spring Boot for the REST API.
There are two models on the application: Posts and comments.
Posts (or news) requires some fields like: Title, content, Date of creation, Author's and a tag field.
Comments has author's name, content and date.
